RULES TO PLAY OTHELLO:

Othello/Reversi is a two player game:


Othello/reversi is a simple game played between two people on 
an 8 x 8 non-checkered board with 64 discs which are black on one side and white on the other. 
The objective is to place your pieces on tht board so as to 
trap your opponents pieces between your own and convert them to your own colour. 
Each piece is black on one side and white on the other, with one colour assigned to each player.
The game begins with two pieces of each colour on the board and the players must 
take it in turns to then try and capture their opponent's pieces.
The player with black disks typically goes first.
The player can trap the pieces horizontally, vertically or diagonally. 
The trapped pieces of the opponent then convert to your own colour.
The player can only play on squares that allow the capture to occur. Such places are indicated by 
the presence of small sized pieces of your own colour. You can only place one piece in one turn..

If there is nowhere a player can place a piece that will trap and flip any of the opponent's pieces, 
the turn counts as a pass.Once there are no legal moves left, 
the player with the most number of pieces showing their colour is winner.
